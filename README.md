Contains code for downloading, exploring, and working with Tailte Éireann's Valuations Data, from their Open API. 

`0_data_extraction.R` downloads the code directly from TÉ. R scripts starting with `1` are exploratory files, `2` are for files that went into the final Financial Stability Note at the Central Bank of Ireland.
