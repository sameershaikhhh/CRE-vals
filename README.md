# Outline
Contains code for downloading, exploring, and working with Tailte Éireann's Valuations Data, from their Open API. 

`0_data_extraction.R` downloads the code directly from TÉ. R scripts starting with `1` are exploratory files, `2` are for files that went into the final Financial Stability Note at the Central Bank of Ireland.

BPLIM has a Git workshop, so does Luis Fonseca, and Bocconi's LEAP Website has several learning resources. 

# Further Notes
Please note that the repository does not include any data from MSCI, including commercially sourced data from MSCI's Real Capital Analytics, which was used to estimate the market value of professionally-managed investor-owned residential properties in Ireland.
